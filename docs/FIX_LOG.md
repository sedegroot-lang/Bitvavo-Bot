## #001 — invested_eur desync after external buys (2026-03-25)

### Symptom
Dashboard showed wrong P&L for all open trades. Bitvavo showed:
- AVAX: +0.38% profit, bot dashboard showed +26.49%
- ALGO: -4.69% loss, bot showed +2.91%
- NEAR: -7.35% loss, bot showed -0.14%

The `invested_eur` field was too low (stuck at pre-external-buy values), making profits appear inflated.

### Root Cause (3 overlapping bugs)

1. **`derive_cost_basis` used `opened_ts` filter**: When the sync engine called
   `derive_cost_basis(bitvavo, market, amount, opened_ts=opened_ts)`, the `opened_ts`
   was set to the bot's restart/sync time (NOT the actual first buy). This caused
   the API to only return trades AFTER that timestamp, missing earlier buys that
   are part of the current position. Even though there was a fallback to fetch all
   trades, the result could still be wrong due to pagination issues.

2. **Three overlapping sync checks fought each other**: The sync engine had:
   - STALE check (50% threshold — almost never triggered)
   - Invested drift check (5% threshold — triggered but used wrong opened_ts)
   - CONSISTENCY GUARD (forced invested_eur = buy_price × amount)
   These checks conflicted: if derive partially succeeded (updated buy_price but
   not invested_eur), the CONSISTENCY GUARD would propagate the wrong buy_price
   to invested_eur. If derive failed, the fallback set invested_eur = old_buy_price
   × new_amount (wrong because old_buy_price didn't include the new buys).

3. **Dashboard `max()` hack masked the problem**: The dashboard used
   `invested = max(invested_eur, buy_price × amount)` which showed the HIGHER value.
   When buy_price was wrong (too high), this overstated the cost basis, but in a
   different direction than the actual error. This made the displayed P&L look
   plausible even though the underlying data was wrong.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `modules/cost_basis.py` | `derive_cost_basis()` now ALWAYS fetches full trade history (ignores `opened_ts`). The parameter is kept for API compat but never used as filter. |
| `bot/sync_engine.py` | Replaced 3 overlapping checks with ONE unified approach: re-derive on amount change, missing invested, periodic (4h), or >2% divergence. Uses `derive_cost_basis` as single source of truth. No `opened_ts` filter. |
| `trailing_bot.py` | GUARD 7 no longer blindly forces `invested_eur = buy_price*amount`. Only fills in when invested_eur is 0. Logs warning for >10% divergence. |
| `tools/dashboard_flask/app.py` | Removed `max()` hack. Uses `invested_eur` directly as it's now kept correct by sync engine. |
| `data/trade_log.json` | Fixed current data with correct values derived from Bitvavo transaction history. |

### Correct Values (from Bitvavo "Mijn assets" P&L on 2026-03-25)
- AVAX-EUR: cost_basis=€207.38, avg_price=€8.303
- ALGO-EUR: cost_basis=€250.62, avg_price=€0.07960
- NEAR-EUR: cost_basis=€259.81, avg_price=€1.1946

### Prevention
- `derive_cost_basis` always uses full order history (no date filter)
- Sync engine re-derives on ANY amount change (>0.1%)
- Periodic 4-hour re-derive as safety net
- Test: `tests/test_cost_basis_sync.py` validates the complete flow
- GUARD 7 in `validate_and_repair_trades` logs >10% divergence for manual review

### How to verify data is correct
Compare bot's invested_eur with Bitvavo's "Ongerealiseerde P&L":
```
bitvavo_cost_basis = saldo_eur + abs(unrealized_pnl_eur)  # when P&L is negative
bitvavo_cost_basis = saldo_eur - unrealized_pnl_eur       # when P&L is positive
```
Bot's invested_eur should be within ~1% of bitvavo_cost_basis (difference is fees).

## #002 — trading_sync.py filter silently drops positions on API glitch (2026-03-25)

### Symptom
After bot restart, AVAX-EUR disappeared from open_trades. The sync_debug.json showed
only 2 mapped markets (NEAR, ALGO) even though trade_log.json had 3 open trades.
Investigation revealed AVAX was actually sold at 19:23 by the old bot via trailing_tp
(sell_price=€8.37, profit=+€0.66), so the removal was correct in this case.
However, the code path that removed it is dangerous for transient API failures.

### Root Cause
`modules/trading_sync.py` has a `filtered_state` line that retains ONLY markets present
in the current Bitvavo balance API response:
```python
filtered_state = {m: e for m, e in open_state.items() if m in open_markets and open_markets[m] > 0}
```
This filter **bypasses** the `DISABLE_SYNC_REMOVE=True` config guard. If the Bitvavo
balance API has a transient failure (returns incomplete data), ALL positions missing
from the response are silently deleted from trade_log.json — even though they still
exist on the exchange.

Additionally, `modules/trading_sync.py` could only reconstruct missing positions from
`pending_saldo.json`, not from Bitvavo order history. If a position existed on Bitvavo
but wasn't in pending_saldo, it was silently ignored.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `modules/trading_sync.py` | `filtered_state` now respects `DISABLE_SYNC_REMOVE`. When True, positions missing from API are KEPT (not silently dropped). Logs a warning instead. |
| `modules/trading_sync.py` | Added auto-discover via `derive_cost_basis()`: if a Bitvavo balance has no matching open trade AND isn't in pending_saldo, the sync now derives cost basis from order history and creates the trade entry automatically. |

### Prevention
- With `DISABLE_SYNC_REMOVE=True` (default), positions are never silently dropped
- Auto-discover catches orphan positions via derive_cost_basis
- `bot/sync_engine.py` already had proper auto-discover; now `modules/trading_sync.py` does too

## #003 — Disable all time-based exits and loss sells (2026-03-25)

### Symptom
User does not want any trade to be closed based on time, and no trade may EVER be sold at a loss.

### What was disabled

| Mechanism | File | What it did | Action |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| Hard stop-loss | `bot/trailing.py` `check_stop_loss()` | Sold at >15% loss | Function now always returns `(False, "disabled")` |
| Time stop-loss | `bot/trailing.py` `check_stop_loss()` | Sold after N days + loss | Same: always returns False |
| 48h exit | `bot/trailing.py` `check_advanced_exit_strategies()` | Sold at >3% profit after 48h | Code removed |
| 24h tighten | `bot/trailing.py` `check_advanced_exit_strategies()` | Set `time_tighten` flag after 24h | Code removed |
| time_tighten consumption | `bot/trailing.py` `calculate_stop_levels()` | Tightened trailing stop by 50% | Code removed |
| Hard SL sell path | `trailing_bot.py` ~L2852 | Executed sell on stop-loss trigger | Wrapped in `if False:` — unreachable |

### Still active (profit-gated, safe)
- Trailing TP: already has `real_profit <= 0` guard (blocks loss sells)
- Partial TP: only triggers at configured profit thresholds
- Volatility spike exit: requires >5% profit
- Auto-free slots: requires >0.5% profit
- Max age / max drawdown: both have loss-blocking guards

### Prevention
- `check_stop_loss()` is a no-op; even if config enables it, nothing happens
- Hard SL sell path is dead code (`if False:`)
- Tests updated to assert stop-loss never triggers

## #004 — dca_buys inflated to buy_order_count on synced positions (2026-03-26)

### Symptom
XRP-EUR showed `dca_buys=17` despite having zero DCA events executed. Same for NEAR and ALGO.

### Root Cause
`modules/sync_validator.py` `auto_add_missing_positions()` set `dca_buys = max(1, result.buy_order_count)` where `buy_order_count` is ALL historical buy orders for the market (including old closed positions). For XRP with 17+ historical buy orders, this set `dca_buys=17` on a brand-new position.

Additionally, `dca_max` was inflated to `max(config_dca_max, dca_buys)` — so with `dca_buys=17` and config `DCA_MAX_BUYS=17`, `dca_max=17`. This made all repair guards in `trailing_bot.py` (GUARD 1 and GUARD 5) ineffective because `dca_buys == dca_max`.

GUARD 5 used `min(max(dca_buys_now, actual_event_count), dca_max_now)` which NEVER reduced `dca_buys` below its current value — even when `dca_events` was empty.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `modules/sync_validator.py` L296 | `dca_buys = 0` for newly synced positions (not `max(1, buy_order_count)`) |
| `modules/sync_validator.py` L315 | Same fix in FIFO fallback path |
| `modules/sync_validator.py` L413 | `dca_max` uses config value, not `max(config, dca_buys)` |
| `trailing_bot.py` GUARD 5 ~L893 | `correct_buys = min(actual_event_count, dca_max_global)` — now based on `dca_events` count, not `max(dca_buys, events)` |
| trade_log.json | Reset all open trades: `dca_buys=0`, `dca_max` from config |

### Key rule
`dca_buys` must ALWAYS equal `len(dca_events)`. A newly synced position has `dca_buys=0` because the bot hasn't executed any DCAs. `buy_order_count` from cost_basis includes historical orders from old positions and must NEVER be used as a DCA counter.

## #005 — DCA cascading: multiple buys at same price in one cycle (2026-03-26)

### Symptom
Bot executed 3 DCAs on NEAR-EUR and 2 on ALGO-EUR within 2 minutes, ALL at the same
market price (1.0563 / 0.0731). Burned through €175 of €178 balance. Each successive
DCA had decreasing EUR amounts (36→33→29) due to 0.9x multiplier but the price never
dropped further between buys.

### Root Cause
In `_execute_fixed_dca` and `_execute_dynamic_dca`, the DCA target price was calculated
from `buy_price` (weighted average entry price):
```python
target_price = float(trade.get("buy_price", current_price)) * (1 - step_pct)
```
After each DCA buy, `buy_price` is recalculated as a weighted average which DROPS (since
we're averaging down). The while loop immediately checks the next DCA level using this
new lower `buy_price`. Since the market price hasn't changed, and the new target is still
above market price, the next DCA triggers too. This cascades until `max_buys_per_iteration`
(which was 3) is exhausted.

Example with NEAR: buy_price=1.23, current=1.056, drop=2.5%:
- DCA1: target=1.23*0.975=1.20 → 1.056 < 1.20 → trigger. buy_price drops to ~1.15
- DCA2: target=1.15*0.975=1.12 → 1.056 < 1.12 → trigger. buy_price drops to ~1.10
- DCA3: target=1.10*0.975=1.07 → 1.056 < 1.07 → trigger. max_per_iter=3, stops.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_fixed_dca` | Target calculated from `last_dca_price` instead of `buy_price`. After each DCA, `last_dca_price` = current execution price, so next DCA needs genuine further drop. |
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_fixed_dca` | `dca_next_price` after buy also uses `last_dca_price` as reference |
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_dynamic_dca` | Same two fixes in the dynamic DCA path |
| `bot_config_local.json` | `DCA_MAX_BUYS_PER_ITERATION`: 3 → 1 (extra safety — max 1 DCA per 25s bot cycle) |
| `tests/test_dca_buys_corruption.py` | Updated `test_multiple_dcas_in_one_call` to expect 1 DCA (not 3), fixed mock `**kwargs` |

### Key rule
DCA target must be based on `last_dca_price` (where the bot LAST bought), not `buy_price`
(weighted average). Each DCA should require `drop_pct` additional decline from the previous
DCA execution price. `DCA_MAX_BUYS_PER_ITERATION` should be 1 for safety.

## #006 — dca_buys=17 re-inflation + XRP invested_eur wrong (2026-03-27)

### Symptom
XRP-EUR dashboard showed 17 DCAs (only 0 real), +56.32% profit when the trade was
actually near breakeven or loss. All three open trades (XRP, NEAR, ALGO) had `dca_buys=17`.
XRP also showed `invested_eur=€41.86` while `buy_price*amount=€66.95` (37% too low).

### Root Cause (5 overlapping bugs)

1. **GUARD 5 NameError (`dca_max_now` undefined)**: `trailing_bot.py` GUARD 5 referenced
   `dca_max_now` which doesn't exist (should be `dca_max_global`). This crashed the guard
   silently, so it NEVER corrected inflated `dca_buys` values.

2. **sync_engine re-inflates dca_buys from buy_order_count**: `bot/sync_engine.py`'s 4-hour
   periodic re-derive set `dca_buys = buy_order_count - 1` from ALL historical orders
   (including old closed positions). With 17+ historical buys, this set dca_buys=16 or 17
   every 4 hours, undoing any correction from FIX #004.

3. **trade_store validation refused to reduce dca_buys**: `modules/trade_store.py`
   `_validate_and_fix_trade_data()` only increased dca_buys upward to match dca_events.
   When `dca_buys > dca_events`, it warned but KEPT the inflated value "to prevent
   duplicate DCA". For synced positions with 0 real DCAs, this preserved dca_buys=17.

4. **FIFO dust threshold too tight (1e-8)**: `modules/cost_basis.py` reset the position
   only when `pos_amount <= 1e-8`. Crypto dust from old positions (e.g., 0.01 XRP worth
   €0.01) exceeded this threshold, causing old position costs at cheap prices to bleed
   into the current position's cost basis. This made `invested_eur` too low.

5. **XRP invested_eur set from contaminated derive**: The FIFO included old cheap XRP buys
   from previous positions. Because old position sells left dust > 1e-8, the position
   never fully reset. New buys were averaged with old cheap costs, producing
   `invested_eur=€41.86` instead of the correct ~€66.95.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `trailing_bot.py` GUARD 5 | Fixed `dca_max_now` → `dca_max_global` (NameError that silently crashed the guard) |
| `bot/sync_engine.py` | Removed dca_buys inflation from `buy_order_count`. Comment explains: dca_buys must ONLY change when bot executes a DCA buy |
| `modules/trade_store.py` | Validation: reduce dca_buys to 0 only when `dca_events` is empty. When events exist but fewer than dca_buys (events lost during sync/restart), keep dca_buys to prevent duplicate DCAs |
| `modules/cost_basis.py` | FIFO dust threshold: `pos_amount <= 1e-8` → `pos_amount < 1e-6 or pos_cost < €1.00`. Catches crypto dust without affecting legitimate partial sells |
| `data/trade_log.json` | XRP: dca_buys 17→0, invested_eur €41.86→€66.95. NEAR/ALGO: dca_buys kept at 17 (legitimate, events partially lost) |

### Key Rules
- `dca_buys=0` when `dca_events` is empty (synced position, no bot-tracked DCAs)
- `dca_buys >= len(dca_events)` when events exist (events can be lost during sync/restart, keep dca_buys to prevent duplicate DCA)
- NEVER derive `dca_buys` from `buy_order_count` (includes old closed positions)
- `invested_eur` must be consistent with `buy_price * amount` (within fee margin)
- FIFO position reset must catch crypto dust (value < €1), not just amount < 1e-8

### Prevention
- GUARD 5 now works (NameError fixed) — resets dca_buys to 0 only when dca_events is empty
- When dca_events exist but fewer than dca_buys (events lost), dca_buys is preserved
- sync_engine no longer touches dca_buys during re-derives
- FIFO uses value-based dust detection (€1 threshold) to prevent old history contamination

## #007 — Event-sourced DCA state: dca_buys desync structurally impossible (2026-03-27)

### Symptom
dca_buys kept desyncing from actual DCA events due to 6+ different code paths
independently mutating the counter: `_execute_fixed_dca`, `_execute_dynamic_dca`,
`_execute_pyramid_up`, `sync_engine`, `trade_store` validation, and `trailing_bot`
GUARD 5. Each had slightly different logic, and bugs in one weren't caught by others.

### Root Cause
`dca_buys` was a standalone mutable counter updated independently in 6+ places.
`dca_events` was a separate list that should have been the source of truth but wasn't
— many code paths updated `dca_buys` without touching `dca_events` (e.g., pyramid_up),
or used `dca_buys` as the authoritative value when events were the ground truth.

### Fix Applied — Event-sourced architecture (`core/dca_state.py`)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `core/dca_state.py` | **NEW MODULE**: Event-sourced DCA state. `dca_events` is the SINGLE source of truth. `dca_buys = len(dca_events)` ALWAYS. Provides `record_dca()` (only way to add DCA), `sync_derived_fields()` (recompute from events), `validate_events()`, `detect_untracked_buys()`. |
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_fixed_dca` | Replaced 20 lines of inline state mutations with `dca_state.record_dca()` call |
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_dynamic_dca` | Same: replaced inline mutations with `record_dca()` |
| `modules/trading_dca.py` `_execute_pyramid_up` | Now uses `add_dca()` + `record_dca()` (was directly assigning invested_eur and NOT creating events) |
| `trailing_bot.py` GUARD 0+1+4+5 | Replaced 4 separate DCA guards with single `sync_derived_fields()` call |
| `bot/sync_engine.py` | Added `sync_derived_fields()` call after every cost basis re-derive |
| `modules/trade_store.py` | Replaced manual Rule 4 (dca_buys consistency) with `sync_derived_fields()` call + fallback |
| `tests/test_dca_state.py` | **35 tests** covering: bot DCA, manual detection, restart recovery, cascading prevention, inflated dca_buys |

### Key Design Rules
- `record_dca()` is the **ONLY** way to add a DCA — it atomically: creates event, appends to events list, recomputes dca_buys, updates last_dca_price, calculates dca_next_price
- `sync_derived_fields()` is the **ONLY** validation — recomputes all derived DCA fields from events
- `dca_buys` stored in trade dict for backward compat, but always recomputed from events
- `_execute_pyramid_up` now records events (was silently skipping event creation)

### Prevention
- dca_buys desync is **structurally impossible**: only `record_dca()` can increment it, and it always equals `len(dca_events)`
- All 4 integration points (trading_dca, trailing_bot, sync_engine, trade_store) use the same module
- 35 unit tests cover all 5 scenarios from the user's DCA redesign specification

## #007b — dca_buys re-inflation via trading_sync.py cache + sync_engine dca_max (2026-06-24)

### Symptom
After #007 was deployed, XRP dca_buys immediately jumped back to 17. NEAR/ALGO also 17.

### Root Cause (2 missed code paths in #007)

1. **`modules/trading_sync.py` L609**: When a trade disappears and reappears (common during sync),
   `removed_cache` stores the old dca_buys. On restore, `max(current, cached)` was used — this
   only increases, so the inflated value 17 was restored from cache every time.

2. **`bot/sync_engine.py` L281**: `dca_max = max(inferred_max, dca_buys)` used dca_buys to inflate
   dca_max. When dca_buys was already 17 (from cache), dca_max also became 17.

3. **Snapshot save** in trading_sync.py saved the inflated dca_buys to cache, perpetuating the cycle.

### Fix Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `modules/trading_sync.py` L609 | Replaced `max()` restore with `setdefault()` — cache value only used if no existing value |
| `modules/trading_sync.py` post-restore | Added `sync_derived_fields()` call after cache restore — events override any cached dca_buys |
| `modules/trading_sync.py` snapshot save | Snapshot now uses `len(dca_events)` as source of truth instead of raw `dca_buys` |
| `bot/sync_engine.py` L281 | Removed `max(..., dca_buys)` — dca_max now comes from `inferred_max` or config `DCA_MAX_BUYS`, never inflated by dca_buys |
| `data/trade_log.json` | Corrected: XRP dca_buys=0, NEAR=3, ALGO=2 (matching event counts) |

### Prevention
- `sync_derived_fields()` now called after EVERY trade state restoration (trading_sync cache restore)
- Cache snapshot stores event-derived count, not raw field
- dca_max no longer uses dca_buys as input (prevents circular inflation)
